### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I am Valentin RICHARD

I am a student in the engineering school Polytech Annecy. I am learning data science and IT project management and I will study software engineering and cybersecurity in Sherbrooke (Canada) next year. 

You can find some of my projetcs here. Take care because some are abandonned or are waiting to be updated. The goal is to learn (code and git technology) and to show some little things I can do.
